# SlowFastDeceptionDetection

This repository has the code for my Monograph (or Final Year Project, or "Trabalho de Conclus√£o de Curso", depending on how you might call it): "Video-based Deception Detection with Deep Learning".

## Abstract

Decption Detection is a task in which humans show outstanding difficulty, reaching an accuracy of only 54% according to the literature. Despite that, this task becomes significantly relevant in contexts such as trials, interviews and criminal investigations, in which the impact of mistakenly classifying a discourse as deceptive or truthful may be catastrophic. In this sense, lies and their identification have spiked the interest of researchers for centuries, wih the creation of devices destined to aid in deception detection and, more recently, with the development of Machine Learning and Deep Learning systems capable of properly classfying them. Based on these systems, this work analyzes literature on the subject and implements a Deep Neural Network based on the SlowFast architecture using the Real-Life Trial dataset reaching an accuracy of 66.36%. Special consideration is given to ethical issues and limitations concerning the use of Machine Learning and Deep Learning systems that perform deception detection, with the recommendation that these systems not be used in real-life situations given the existing limitations for their satisfactory development.

This work is being further developed and a paper with the complete work should be written soon. Stay tuned!
